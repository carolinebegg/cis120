(* Biologists estimate the "relatedness" of different species by comparing
   their genetic codes. As techniques to gather genetic information
   have become more sophisticated, it has become common to use computer
   programs to aid in analyzing genetic information. Your task in this homework
   is to develop functions that help in understanding genetic data. In
   particular, one task that you will perform is to use this data to determine
   the genetic similarity of different species. You will be doing this by
   analyzing sample DNA (provided below) for several ape species.

   To achieve this goal, you will be guided through writing several OCaml
   functions that can be combined for processing DNA strands and generating
   candidate genetic trees to be used for analysis.

   DO NOT FEAR THE BIOLOGY! While this assignment uses real biological data, we
   will walk you through all the necessary concepts and terminology.

   Happy coding! :) *)

(* Unlike homework 1, we've given you a number of INCOMPLETE tests in
   the dnaTest.ml file. The first provided test for each problem is
   ready to go, but for some of the test cases you will need to
   provide the expected value, which you should calculate by
   hand. Before implementing each function, complete its corresponding
   test section in dnaTest.ml. We use the OCaml primitive "failwith"
   to cause an error so you know you have to fill in something.

   The test cases for all functions in this assignment are found in the file
   dnaTest.ml. *)

   Biologists use trees (Figure A on the above web page) to show how species
   evolved (or might have evolved) from ancestor species. To practice using
   enumeration and recursion over lists and trees, you are going to
   write a program that automatically generates hypothesis trees like the one
   in Figure A.

(* ----- DNA Data representation -------------------------------------------- *)
(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* Your program inputs will be real samples of DNA, the genetic code that
   describes how to build organisms (Figure B).

   Each double helix of DNA consists of two complementary strands,
   each one a sequence of the nucleotides adenine, thymine, guanine,
   and cytosine. Adenine always appears opposite thymine, and guanine
   always appears opposite cytosine.

   At the top of this file, we imported the type definitions for
   nucleotides and helices from `helices.ml`.  We have duplicated the
   definitions here for your convenience:

   type nucleotide =
    | G (* guanine *)
    | C (* cytosine *)
    | A (* adenine *)
    | T (* thymine *)

    type helix = nucleotide list *)

   extracted from the Entrez Nucleotide database
   (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore)

   Feel free to take a look at that file and see the sequence data! *)

(* To help with printing trees that contain this data, we provide the
   following function to convert helices to the corresponding species
   name. *)

   Ape!" if the helix doesn't match any of the ape helices. *)

(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* For this assignment, we represent individual nucleotides using an
   enumeration and represent DNA sequences as a nucleotide list. The
   list corresponds to just one helix in the double helix. However,
   since nucleotides always appear in a complementary fashion, we --
   i.e., you :) -- can easily calculate the other helix... *)

   to start each problem by first finishing the corresponding test section in

(* ----- Problem 2: Compute the hamming distance between two helices -------- *)
(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* Given two equal-length helices, your next task is to compute the
   number of differences between the nucleotide sequences, i.e., the
   number of nucleotides that would need to be changed to transform
   one helix into the other.

   Warning: You should ASSUME that this function will always be
   applied to two lists with the same number of elements.  Do NOT test
   the lengths of the lists when implementing this function.  If you
   do so, your code may be ungradeable because it is TOO SLOW (e.g.,
   it would require a length calculation to occur at every recursive
   invocation).  It does not matter what this function returns when
   applied to different length lists. *)

let rec hamming_distance (x1: helix) (x2: helix) : int =
  begin match x1, x2 with
    | [], [] -> 0
    | [], y -> 0

      then hamming_distance tail1 tail2
      else 1 + hamming_distance tail1 tail2
  end

(* We can use the hamming_distance function to determine the similarities
   between various species.

   After you have a correct implementation of hamming_distance,
   uncomment the following printing commands, run the program to see
   the output in the console, and then fill in the answer to
   'question_most_like_human' below. *)

(* Next, based on the number of mutations that were printed in the
   console, order the seven non-human ape helices by their similarity
   to humans, with the *most* human-like helix appearing first in the
   list.

   Your answer should be hard-coded, e.g. [chimp; gorilla; ...]

   Note that you may have to scroll up in the terminal window to see
   the output! *)

let question_most_like_human () : helix list =
  [chimpanzee; gorilla; orangutan; siamang; pileated_gibbon;

(* To test your answer, write a function that determines whether a
   list of helices is ordered in STRICTLY DECREASING similarity to humans.
   (This function should return true for lists that are empty or that
   contain exactly one helix.) *)

(* DNA describes how to build organisms by encoding instructions for making
   amino acid chains, which in turn enable basic cellular functions. In this
   problem, you will write functions that determine the amino acid chains that
   are encoded in a particular helix.

   The key to this decoding is that every nucleotide triplet in the helix
   encodes one of 20 acids, or else indicates the end of the chain. *)

(* Your next task: given a helix, decode its first acid chain. This is
   done as follows...

   1. Start decoding by scanning the helix for the first occurrence of
      the sequence [T; A; C] (which encodes the acid Met). This starts
      an acid chain with Met as its head element.
   '
   2. After the first occurrence of [T; A; C], decode the following
      nucleotides in the helix in triplets and build a list of the
      results.

   3. Stop decoding when either (a) we run out of triplets or (b) we
      encounter one of the triplets encoding the END acid ([A; T; T],
      [A; C; T], or [A; T; C]). If we encounter the END acid, the END
      marker should NOT be included in the output acid list.

   You should disregard any nucleotides that might happen to occur
   before the first occurrence of Met (including END markers).  *)

(* The next problem is not required. It is worth zero points, but it
   will challenge your ability to work with recursive functions over

   back to it after you have finished the rest of the assignment. *)

(* Problem 3 above asks you to decode the first acid chain of a
   helix. However, a given helix may actually describe a sequence of
   several chains. Your job now is to write a function that produces
   *all* of these chains, not just the first one.

   A few points to observe:
   - You should look for the next acid chain after the end triplet of the
     previous chain.
   - The beginning of the next chain (TAC) may not be immediately
     after the end of the previous one: there could be any number of
     nucleotides in between.
   - You should not decode overlapping chains. If, in the middle
     of one amino acid-encoding nucleotide sequence there's another
     T-A-C, you shouldn't also return that acid list.
   - We've given you a few tests for this problem in dnaTest.ml. *)

(* ----- Problem 4:  Representing phylogenetic trees ------------------------ *)
(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* Now that we have a DNA datatype and some ape data, we can analyze
   this data to figure out the relationship between the various
   present-day species. That relationship is described by
   evolutionary (or phylogenetic) trees, which show how the common
   ancestors for each species relate to each other. Specifically, we
   will take four ape helices and:

   1. First, generate all possible evolutionary trees with the ape DNA
      at the leaves. Each tree represents a possible set of family
      relationships among the given species.

   2. Next, take these generated trees and fill in hypothetical
      genetic codes for the ancestor species. These hypothetical codes
      will be stored in an auxiliary data structure called a
      labeled_tree (where internal nodes also store genetic
      information).

   3. Then, estimate each labeled_tree's complexity, and guess at how
      many evolutionary events were required to create the given tree.

   4. Finally, return the simplest (i.e., most biologically plausible)
      tree, stripping off the guessed ancestors.

   Before completing the remaining problems of this assignment, you
   should read through all of them so that you can see how they fit
   together and correspond to the four steps above. *)

(* An evolutionary tree is a binary tree whose leaves are labeled with
   DNA helices. As we learned in lecture, a binary tree is either
   a Node or a Leaf. A Leaf merely contains a value with no children,
   while a Node contains two "child" trees; these "children" represent
   the two subtrees underneath this particular Node in the overall
   tree structure. *)

type tree =
  | Leaf of helix
  | Node of tree * tree

(* In this homework assignment, we will evaluate our algorithm using
   the *real* evolutionary tree that scientists believe describes the
   relationships between ape species. The real tree is shown in Figure
   A on the homework website
   (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1200/current/hw/hw02/).

   For example, we can represent the left side of the tree from Figure A as
   follows: *)

let greater_apes () : tree =

    Leaf orangutan,
    Node (
      Leaf gorilla,
      Node (
        Leaf human,
        Leaf chimpanzee
      )
    )
  )

(* The following function can be used to display evolutionary trees in
   the console. Given a tree whose leaves are labeled with the ape
   helices, it outputs a string containing an "ascii art" picture of
   the tree.  You are not expected to follow the details of how it
   works. *)

(* One way to test that you have defined 'lesser_apes' correctly is to
   count the number of species that it contains. We can calculate this
   number by counting the number of leaf nodes in the tree.

   Remember that type tree is a recursive datatype. When you solve
   count_leaves (as well as the rest of the problems in this
   assignment) keep in mind that your function should utilize
   recursion. Use the tree type definition above to help you come up
   with your patterns for pattern matching.

(* ------------------- Problem 5:  Guessing ancestors  ---------------------- *)
(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* Now on to step 2 of our roadmap: comparing the generated
   evolutionary trees from above, with the help of an intermediate
   data structure called a 'labeled_tree'. This data structure is
   almost like the evolutionary tree, except that internal nodes are
   labeled with guesses about the dna data of ancestor species. *)

type labeled_tree =
  | LLeaf of helix
  | LNode of labeled_tree * helix * labeled_tree

(* The following helper function (for you to write) will be useful later on: *)

(* Find the helix contained within the root node of a given labeled_tree.
   This function should output the helix in the leaf when the tree is just a
   leaf. The type definition will be helpful here. *)

let helix_of_tree (t: labeled_tree) : helix =
  begin match t with
    | LLeaf x -> x
    | LNode (lt1, h, lt2) -> h
  end

(* Our goal is to compare labeled trees, but it is worth thinking
   first about what we will do once we find the best one. We would
   like to produce an (unlabeled) evolutionary tree, so we will need
   to strip off the guessed ancestors.

   Given a labeled_tree as defined above, we can do this by returning a tree of
   identical structure with the helix in each Node removed. Don't forget to add
   another test for unlabel_tree in dnaTest.ml. *)

    | LNode (lt1, h, lt2) -> Node (unlabel_tree lt1, unlabel_tree lt2)
  end

(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* The next step is to label the internal nodes of our generated trees. See
   Figure C (on the instruction page for the homework) for a completely labeled
   candidate tree whose helices are of length four. Figure C is sample output
   for add_ancestor_labels, which you'll write below. *)

(* BEFORE WRITING add_ancestor_labels, READ CAREFULLY THROUGH THE HELPER
   FUNCTION guess_parent_helix AND FILL IN THE REQUIRED TEST CASE RESULTS. *)

(* Assuming x1 and x2 are valid helices, guess the valid helix that labels their
   parent node in an evolutionary tree. The guessed helix is computed using
   nucleotide-by-nucleotide comparison of x1 and x2: if the nucleotides match,
   the corresponding parent nucleotide is the same. If they don't match, the
   corresponding parent nucleotide is (arbitrarily) A. *)


let rec guess_parent_helix (x1: helix) (x2: helix) : helix =

(* Now we want to use the guess_parent_helix function to fill in the
   guess the DNA of all the ancestor species in an evolutionary tree,
   given the DNA of their present-day descendants. *)

(* Given an unlabeled tree, generate a tree with the same shape but with all
   internal nodes properly labeled. Use guess_parent_helix to compute the
   appropriate label for a parent node, given the labels of its two children.

   Some points to remember...

   - Your function should work for a tree of ANY height; make sure to test this
     prior to continuing with the assignment. We have provided a test stub
     reminding you to test this in dnaTest.ml.

   - You should NOT assume that all input trees are "balanced"; that is, the
     left and right sub-trees of any node may in general have different numbers
     of nodes!

   - Keep in mind: if you find yourself writing the same segment of code
     multiple times, that is often an indicator that that segment can be
     stored as a variable to be reused in multiple places. This will also
     make your code run faster! :) *)

let rec add_ancestor_labels (t: tree) : labeled_tree =
  begin match t with
    | Leaf x -> LLeaf (x)
    | Node (lt1, lt2) -> 
      let left = add_ancestor_labels lt1 in
      let right = add_ancestor_labels lt2 in 
      let n = guess_parent_helix (helix_of_tree left) (helix_of_tree right) in
      LNode (left, n, right)
  end


(* Once your test cases for add_ancestor_labels pass, this function can be used
   to label all of the trees for the greater and lesser apes.

   To label ALL of the trees in the list of candidates, we define (for
   you) the following helper function: *)

let rec add_ancestor_labels_list (ts: tree list) : labeled_tree list =
  begin match ts with
    | []       -> []
    | hd :: tl -> add_ancestor_labels hd :: add_ancestor_labels_list tl
  end

(* Labeled trees for lesser and greater apes. *)

let labeled_greater_ape_trees () : labeled_tree list =
  add_ancestor_labels_list (all_greater_ape_trees ())

let labeled_lesser_ape_trees () : labeled_tree list =
  add_ancestor_labels_list (all_lesser_ape_trees ())

(* ----- Problem 6: Parent-Child Hamming Distance --------------------------- *)
(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* Now let's move to step 3. We want to compare the labeled_trees by
   calculating their "complexity" and then choosing the simplest /
   most plausible one. We measure the complexity of a tree by summing
   the number of mutations needed to convert between its parent and
   child DNA sequences. *)

(* Given a labeled tree, compute the sum of Hamming distances between
   all parent-child pairs (where "parent-child pair" refers to a
   DIRECT parent-child relationship, not just an ancestor relationship).

   Your solution should use the hamming_distance function from Problem
   2. Make sure to check what arguments hamming_distance requires. *)

let rec parent_child_hamming (t: labeled_tree) : int =
  begin match t with
    | LLeaf x -> 0
    | LNode (lt1, h, lt2) ->
      let lefDis = hamming_distance h (helix_of_tree lt1) in
      let rigDis = hamming_distance h (helix_of_tree lt2) in
      parent_child_hamming lt1 + parent_child_hamming lt2 + lefDis + rigDis
  end

(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(* ----- Problem 7: Finding the simplest tree ------------------------------- *)
(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* Finally we are at step 4: Given a list of labeled trees, we want to find the
   simplest one in the list, using the parent_child_hamming function defined
   above to estimate the complexity of the tree.

   The simplest_tree function should, given a list of labeled_trees,
   return both the simplest tree in the list and its complexity. If
   you find two simplest trees -- i.e., two trees that both have the
   lowest complexity -- return the one that appears first in the list.

   Remember that tree A is considered simpler than tree B if the
   complexity of A is less than the complexity of B.

   You can assume that this function will only be applied to a
   non-empty list of labeled_trees. Your function should throw an
   error (using failwith) if it is passed an empty list.

   As always, make sure you add test cases for this function. *)

let rec simplest_tree (ts: labeled_tree list) : labeled_tree * int =
  begin match ts with
    | [] -> failwith "empty list"
    | [x] -> x, parent_child_hamming x
    | v :: tail -> let simplest, number = simplest_tree(tail) in 
      if parent_child_hamming v > number then simplest, number 
      else v, parent_child_hamming v
  end
(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* Finally, we are ready to put everything together to see how well calculating
   evolutionary trees using the parent-child hamming distance complexity measure
   works. *)

let simplest_greater_ape_tree () : tree =
  let (t, _) = simplest_tree (labeled_greater_ape_trees ()) in
  unlabel_tree t

(* We can compare this computed tree with the one in Figure A, to see that this
   methodology works well for greater apes. Uncomment the following printing
   commands to make sure that the result matches the following diagram:

    -------------------------------------------

   Note: If this part of the program runs slowly, you'll want to recomment
   these commands before you submit. *)

   quite exactly, what we wanted. Uncomment the printing commands below to see

(* ----- Problem 8: Refactoring --------------------------------------------- *)
(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* Once you have solved a problem, it is a good idea to go back, look for
   repeated patterns, and generalize your solution. In  this case, if you look
   closely at the computation of the simplest trees for the lesser and greater
   apes, you can see that we are doing the same thing twice. Capture steps 1-4
   with a single function that starts with *any* four ape helices and outputs
   the computed simplest tree.

   Note that your solution should be short (no more than 4 lines long) and you
   should be able to reuse much of the code that you have already developed in
   this assignment. In particular, your implementation should not require
   writing any additional helper functions. *)
